Band-aid fixes for router update via client
- Client will now send updates to both routers involved in link-cost change
- When client is used to update a link-cost, the port number used when invoking client (i.e. "./client localhost <port number>) means nothing (but still pass one in!)
- When updating the DV of a router, the router will "poison" all distance that relied on the updated link-cost by increasing the distances to INT_MAX
- That will cause runDVAlgorithm to correctly identify new, shorter paths that came about as a result of the link-cost update
- New message type "RQST" requests the DV from the destination router; this is used after an update has occurred to ensure that routers compute new DV's using all available information
- NOTE: RQST-messages may need to be used in more places, not entirely sure yet
